# Abyssal Gears: Depths of Iron and Steam

## Project Description

**Abyssal Gears** is an upcoming 2D steampunk pirate game that plunges players into a perilous underwater world. Command your custom-built submarine through procedurally generated oceanic dungeons, engaging in intense combat and seeking out rare parts to enhance your vessel. Inspired by the challenging exploration and strategic depth of _"Souls-like"_ games and the dungeon-crawling progression of _"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon,"_ Abyssal Gears offers a unique blend of action, customization, and replayability.

## Overview

In a world where the surface is a forgotten myth and the depths hold untold riches and dangers, you are a daring steampunk pirate. Your journey begins with a basic submarine, but through cunning, combat, and exploration, you'll transform it into a formidable war machine. Navigate twisting underwater caverns, discover hidden treasures, and clash with rival factions and monstrous deep-sea creatures. Every dive presents new challenges and opportunities for glory.

## Key Features

### Submarine Customization
Tailor your submersible to your playstyle:

- **Appearance**: Modify the hull, fins, and aesthetic elements to create a truly unique look.
- **Machinery**: Upgrade your engine for speed, enhance your propulsion for maneuverability, and install specialized utility systems that impact stamina regeneration, boost efficiency, and more.
- **Weapons**: Outfit your submarine with an array of steampunk weaponry, strategically placed to attack enemies from the left or right. Discover new weapon types with unique firing patterns and effects.

### Procedurally Generated Dungeons

### Unique Visuals with Sprite Stacking
Experience a distinctive 2.5D aesthetic achieved through sprite stacking, giving depth and volume to the 2D pixel art and bringing the intricate steampunk designs to life.

### Resource Management
Carefully manage your submarine's health and a dynamic stamina bar that dictates your ability to boost and perform special maneuvers.

## Gameplay Mechanics

Players will navigate the dark, pressure-filled depths, encountering various enemies and environmental hazards. Combat is fast-paced and requires quick reflexes and strategic positioning.
